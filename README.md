# Sensors Integration
This project consist of energy utilization for cloud based embedded controller when various system is assembled on the controller is chosen to be analyzed. Cloud based embedded controllers are chosen to emulate the real time IoT environment. A few sensors are integrated to embedded devices using ESP 8266 built in wifi module and also Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.
